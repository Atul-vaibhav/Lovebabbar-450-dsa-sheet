GFG 160-Day Challenge 🚀
Welcome to my GFG 160-Day Challenge repository! 🎯

This repository documents my journey through the GeeksforGeeks 160-Day Challenge, where I solve problems daily to improve my coding skills and prepare for technical interviews.

📖 About the Challenge
The GFG 160-Day Challenge is a structured program aimed at enhancing problem-solving abilities, covering a wide range of topics like:

Data Structures (Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Trees, etc.)
Algorithms (Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, etc.)
Competitive Programming concepts
📂 Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

Day-wise Folders: Each day has its dedicated folder (e.g., Day1, Day2, etc.) containing the problems I solved on that day.
Problem Description: Each solution includes comments or a description of the problem for clarity.
Code Files: All solutions are written in Java (or your preferred language).
🏆 Goals
Develop consistency in problem-solving.
Strengthen my foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms.
Prepare for coding interviews and competitive programming challenges.
🔥 Daily Updates
I commit my daily solutions regularly to this repository. Stay tuned for updates as I progress through the challenge!
